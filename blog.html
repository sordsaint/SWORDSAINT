        <h2>Valentines Day! (Feb 14, 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            Had a great valentines day today with my wife. We went to the park and painted my melody and pompompurin figures. We also left a little
            message on a rock which I liked. I love my wife so much. I hope everyone had a great valentines day as well. Even if you didn't spend it
            with a partner I hope you took the day to love yourself and take care of yourself. <img src="assets/rock.jpg" alt="Rock" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px;">

        <h2>My wife loves taco bell.. a lot. (Feb 10, 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            My wife got really hungry today and we decided to order taco bell. She ordered a crunch wrap supreme and I got a chicken quesadilla.
            As im eating I hear a sweet "I love you" from my wife. I say it back as one does and when I look up and she has her face completely paused
            staring at me with a crunch wrap supreme in her mouth.. she was talking about the food. I love her so much.
