        <h2>Big Announcement (Feb 22, 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            I have some really awesome news, at least I think so. I AM WORKING ON A GAME!! All of this is a personal development project however I plan on making it something
            really special. I can't give out too much just yet but it is going to be a point and click mystery horror game. I look forward to showcasing more in the future
            and hope everyone feels the same way. If you would like to keep up with the project I will be posting updates here as well as the socials listed below

        <h2>Scam Job (Feb 17, 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            Good and bad news. Good news is I got accepted at wrestlemania which is great its a 10 day position and I start in April! Bad news is I had another interview
            for a "stable" job that I would start on soon. I did the interview and thankfully I did really good, at least I think so, but thats not the bad part. The bad
            part is after I got accepted I decided to look into the company and unfortunately turns out its a pyramid scheme but I don't feel too bad about falling for it
            because from what I researched they have been doing this to people for years. Im not sure if any of you would know the company but its Vector Marketing. To be
            fair it is my fault for not researching the company BEFORE the interview rather than after but I didn't think too much of it before because I was just excited I
            got asked to interview. Anyways the job search continues!

        <h2>Valentines Day! (Feb 14, 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            Had a great valentines day today with my wife. We went to the park and painted my melody and pompompurin figures. We also left a little
            message on a rock which I liked. I love my wife so much. I hope everyone had a great valentines day as well. Even if you didn't spend it
            with a partner I hope you took the day to love yourself and take care of yourself. <img src="assets/rock.jpg" alt="Rock" style="width: 100%; max-width: 400px; margin-top: 10px;">

        <h2>My wife loves taco bell.. a lot. (Feb 10, 2025)</h2>
        <p>
            My wife got really hungry today and we decided to order taco bell. She ordered a crunch wrap supreme and I got a chicken quesadilla.
            As im eating I hear a sweet "I love you" from my wife. I say it back as one does and when I look up and she has her face completely paused
            staring at me with a crunch wrap supreme in her mouth.. she was talking about the food. I love her so much.
